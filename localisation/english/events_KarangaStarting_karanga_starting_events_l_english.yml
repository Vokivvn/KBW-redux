KarangaStarting_karanga_starting_events.1.d:0 "--INTELLIGENCE REPORT--\n\nFor centuries the African powers have dominated world politics, ruling Europe with an iron jackboot. But news from the Serbian front has worried many in the Karangan government. Serbian troops trained, supplied and even supported by Karagan weapons and war material have failed to make any substantial advance into Poland.\n\nWhispers and rumors coming from the Karangan high command estimate that Poland and her anti-colonial allies will have the strength needed to overwhelm our army in 4 years. This only leaves us 4 years to prepare for a possible large-scale conflict in which the world has never seen since the fall of Rome to Carthage thousands of years ago. On Top of this white militia forces have made rapid gains across the woodlands surrounding major urban centers. We must act now or face total destruction in the coming years…\n\n--END INTELLIGENCE REPORT--"

This goes against the reality of our current military situation, where there has not been a major global war since 1912. Which has led to many military experts taking notes from the "Decade Of Wars" in the 1930s which helped show the power of the air force and its necessity to win ground battles. Simply not innovating and using outdated early 1930s military doctrine will lead to our army being ineffective."
