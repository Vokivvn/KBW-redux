worldflavorevents.1.d:0 "After multiple Russian majority cities across Onoghur-Bulgar rose up against their government after an Alt-Right group took over the country in a bloodless coup, little thought that Rus would intervene. \n\nBut after reports of Bulgar force's ruthless bombing over these rebel cities the Rus government felt that the only course of action was a dash south, to help these rebel republics and to secure their port on the black sea."

worldflavorevents.2.d:0 "Over 150 Nations met in the MK building in Oyo to discuss the future of Central Africa. Central Africa has been occupied since 1943 after the great series of wars known as the "Akunyili Wars". After a lengthy meeting between East and West, no agreement could be reached about a neutral demilitarized Central Africa. Rather both sides have agreed to split the country in half and leave the capital as a joint occupation zone for now."
