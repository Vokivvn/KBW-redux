On top of that, the land itself is vital for the local economies of both border towns, If we don't solve this border dispute soon it may lead to skirmishes or worse, complete diplomatic withdrawal by Nesenga which will leave our country isolated in post-colonial affairs which would lead to a collapse of our primary export, Cheese."

This horrific system of "Apartheid" affects over 80% of the population who are predominantly white. If we are to become a modern nation-state and keep out these so-called "Pan Europeanists" and "Radical Peganists" we must relinquish rights to the locals or face destruction from domestic protests and riots."

rus_democracy_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n £GFX_rusdemocracy_texticon \n\n\n\n\n Novgorod the city which founded European democracy still stands the test of time and acts as a shining example of European excellence. \n\n Formed around 800 AD in the depths of what we now call "Rus" the city-state was all that was left of the Kievan Rus. The City eventually united with neighbouring Slavic city-states and formed one of the world's first democratic societies although corruption and instability plagued the republic for decades with it facing coups, counter-coups false heirs crowning themselves king etc. But in the latter half of the 18th century while the African powers pillaged South America navigators found a way around the Island of Britain which may allow greater trade with Asia and allow for the exploitation of this land. But all they found were two groups, The Slavs & The Khazaks for decades as Africa navigated and colonized western Europe they found themselves in constant conflict with these groups. This eventually allowed Rus & her allies to adopt the Black man's gun powder and rifles which turned the sword fighting ways of the east into one of steel and blood which allowed Rus to maintain the democracy which they have to this day."

Luckily we avoided this fate due to our geographic position. \n\n Our geographic location in the east made it so it prevented the Africans from maintaining any long-term occupation of our lands thanks to General Winter. But this also prevented Europe from developing economically  & socially leaving most of Europe mostly underdeveloped. This has directly resulted in our economy being exponentially small in comparison to nations like Rakotobe or Oyo. Some experts have claimed that the only way for a nation like Rus to economically advance at  a rapid pace is for a large scale war to take place."
