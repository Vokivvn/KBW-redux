chinanazi.2.t:0 "The Little Yellow Men"
chinanazi.2.d:0 "Yesterday Chinese forces intervened in the occurring civil war in Myanmar by sizing the Chindong airport right outside the capital and advancing through the Jinbu Road striking deep into the country. While China denies their intervening as their government is pointing out the soldiers aren't wearing any markers or insignia. This has led to the international world dubbing these soldiers "Little Yellow Men" due to their beige yellowish uniforms."

chinanazi.1.t:0 "Watching The Border"
chinanazi.1.d:0 "After the Rus-Chinse border conflict a few days ago we have realized that our army is nowhere near ready to actually attack the Russian state in government-mandated plans. Our perceived "2 Month Invasion" would presumably last over 5 years and result in millions of deaths. On top of that our men have shown discomfort in charging in massive waves of men into machine gunfire. Overall the status of our army is extremely poor and not ready for any real major conflict with any power and will presumably not be ready for decades to come. We recommend we delay the invasion of Rus until the situation turns in our favour.""
